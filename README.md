hello!
This code uses Dijkstra's algorithm.

Explain how the code works is the link: Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdmfOwyQlcI

We used open source located at the following link: Http://www.cswiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Dijkstra

We took the open source informing and added it "wrapper" which takes two files: In_file_edegs and in_file_queries
And returns the solution (if available) of each track

Complexity -o(O(W*v*E*log|V|) - (w=number of queries)
