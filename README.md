hello!

This code uses Dijkstra's algorithm.

Explain how the code works is the link: Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdmfOwyQlcI

We used open source located at the following link: Http://www.cswiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Dijkstra

We took the open source informing and added it "wrapper" which takes two files: In_file_edegs and in_file_queries
And returns the solution (if available) of each track

Complexity -o(w*v*e*log|V|)
w=number of queries; v=number of nodes; e=number of edges.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**before you run the program you must make sure that you have all the .txt files in the location(defult is: c:\)
the text files is base on 2 files.
in1.txt - this file contains the graph(all the edges and vertex)
in2.txt - this file contains the test we do in order to check what is the shortest from vertex to vertex without spesific vertex(AKA "black list")

How to open the project:

1.open the project with netbeans
2.go to Algo package and then to DijkstraSP
3.look at the main on this class
4.run the program
